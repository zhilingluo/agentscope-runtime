Welcome to the Demohouse repository! This collection provides ready-to-use demo projects built on top of various technologies, designed to accelerate your development process. These demos cover a range of common use cases and complexities, from simple chatbots to complex agent workflows.

## ✨ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the sample agents:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   **Install Agentscope Runtime:** Ensure you have Agentscope Runtime installed and configured. Follow the Python instructions.
    *   **Set Up Environment Variables:** Each agent example relies on a `.env`
        file for configuration (like API keys). This keeps secrets out of the code.
        *   You will need to create a `.env` file in each agent's directory you
            wish to run (usually by copying the provided `.env.template`).


2.  **Explore the Agents:**

    *   Browse the subdirectories. Each contains a specific sample agent with its own
    `README.md`.

3.  **Run an Agent:**
    *   Choose an agent.
    *   Navigate into that agent's specific directory (e.g., `cd chatbot`).
    *   Follow the instructions in *that agent's* `README.md` file for specific
        setup (like installing dependencies via `npm install`) and running
        the agent.
    *   Browse the folders in this repository. Each agent and tool have its own
        `README.md` file with detailed instructions.
