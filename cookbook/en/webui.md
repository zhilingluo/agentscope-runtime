# WebUI

In **WebUI**, there are mainly two ways to call an Agent:

1. **Start directly using `npx`**
2. **Install locally and start the development environment**

Before you begin, we assume you have already **deployed your Agent**.
For example, if it’s deployed at `localhost:8090`, the WebUI will call it via the `process` endpoint, so the full request URL will be:

```bash
http://localhost:8090/process
```

This guide also requires a **Node.js** environment along with `npm` or `npx`. Please make sure they are properly installed.

## Method 1: Start the Agent Directly in Python and Enable the WebUI

This approach is suitable for running the Agent directly in a Python environment and enabling the built‑in WebUI. You only need to ensure that the model environment required by the Agent has been deployed and the API key is properly configured.

```python
from agentscope_runtime.engine import AgentApp

agent_app = AgentApp(
    app_name="Friday",
    app_description="A helpful assistant",
)
# Agent construction logic omitted here

# Start the service and enable the WebUI at the same time
agent_app.run(host="127.0.0.1", port=8090, web_ui=True)
```

## Method 2: Quick Start via `npx`

If you just want to try it out quickly, or don’t need to modify code, you can simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx @agentscope-ai/chat agentscope-runtime-webui --url http://localhost:8090/process
```

> **Note**: Make sure the URL matches your Agent’s deployment address.

Once executed, the frontend service will start at:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/) in your browser and you can enter the WebUI to interact with your Agent via a chat interface.

## Method 3: Local Installation and Startup (for development and customization)

If you plan to go deeper into development or want to customize the WebUI, you can start a local environment in the **AgentScope-Runtime** `web/starter_webui` directory:

```bash
# Go to the WebUI startup directory
cd web/starter_webui

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development service
npm run dev
```

The service will be available at:

```bash
http://localhost:5173
```

Access this address in your browser to open the WebUI and chat with your Agent.

In the WebUI, you can interact with your Agent through a visual interface and even call tools:
