# Concepts

This chapter introduces the core concepts of AgentScope Runtime.

## Architecture

AgentScope Runtime uses a modular architecture with several key components:

- **Agent**: The core AI component that processes requests and generates responses; in the runtime we recommend building agents with the AgentScope framework.
- **AgentApp**: Serves as the application entry point. It exposes APIs, registers routes, loads configurations, and delegates incoming requests to the Runner for execution.
- **Runner**: Orchestrates agent execution and manages deployment at runtime, handling agent lifecycle, session management, streaming responses, and service deployment.
- **Deployer**: Deploys the Runner as a service with health checks, monitoring, lifecycle management, SSE-based real-time streaming, error handling, logging, and graceful shutdown.
- **Tool**: Provides ready-to-use services, such as RAG.
- **Service**: Supplies management capabilities required by agents, such as memory management and sandbox management.
- **Adapter**: Adapters that integrate Runtime-provided components/modules with different Agent frameworks.

### Key Components

#### 1. Agent

The `Agent` is the core component that processes requests and generates responses. Many popular frameworks already provide agent abstractions, so the runtime does not introduce an additional `Agent` class—developers can build the required agents with AgentScope.

#### 2. AgentApp

`AgentApp` is the **application entry point** in AgentScope Runtime. It is used to deploy an agent as an externally accessible API application.

Its responsibilities include:

- Initializing and binding the **Agent** and **Runner**, delegating requests to the runtime for processing
- Providing standardized **HTTP API endpoints** (including health checks)
- Supporting **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** as well as standard JSON responses
- Allowing registration of middlewares, task queues (Celery), and custom routes
- Managing the application lifecycle (supports `before_start` / `after_finish` hooks)

#### 3. Runner

The `Runner` class offers a flexible and extensible runtime that orchestrates agent execution and enables deployment. It manages:

- Agent lifecycle through `init_handler` and `shutdown_handler`
- Request processing through `query_handler`
- Streaming responses
- Service deployment via the `deploy()` method

#### 4. Deployer

The `Deployer` (implemented as `DeployManager`) provides production-grade deployment capabilities:

- Deploying the Runner as a service
- Health checks, monitoring, and lifecycle management
- SSE-based real-time response streaming
- Error handling, logging, and graceful shutdown
- Support for multiple deployment modes (local, containerized, Kubernetes, etc.)

#### 5. Sandbox & Tool

The runtime offers two patterns for integrating tools:

- Ready-to-use tools provided by service vendors, such as RAG
- Tool sandboxes that run securely within the runtime, such as a browser

#### 6. Service

`Service` includes the following components:

- `state_service` for state management
- `memory_service` for agent memory management
- `sandbox_service` for sandbox orchestration
- `session_history_service` for persisting session history

#### 7. Adapter

`Adapter` is categorized based on different Agent frameworks and includes tool adapters, memory adapters, session adapters, message protocol adapters, and more.
