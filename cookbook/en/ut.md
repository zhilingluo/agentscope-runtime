# Reference: Tests

The repository ships with multi-level samples inside the `tests` directory. You can run them directly or read them as references:

- `tests/unit`: Minimal checks for individual modules/functions—useful for understanding low-level APIs.
- `tests/sandbox`: Scenario-style scripts focused on sandbox capabilities, such as `test_sandbox.py` and `test_sandbox_service.py`.
- `tests/deploy`: Simulates deployment flows and service governance for end-to-end validation.
- `tests/integrated`: Cross-module collaboration tests that verify the overall runtime workflow.

Browse these directories and files in the codebase, and run whatever suits your needs to quickly grasp the practical details.
