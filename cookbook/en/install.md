# Installation

Ready to get started with AgentScope Runtime? This guide will help you get up and running with **AgentScope Runtime** in just a few minutes.

## Installation Methods

Agentscope Runtime supports two installation methods: **PyPI** and **from source**. Both methods require Python 3.10 or higher.

### Install via PyPI

```{warning}
This project is under rapid development and iteration. We recommend installing from source to get the latest features and bug fixes.
```

To install the stable release of Agentscope Runtime via PyPI, use:

```bash
pip install agentscope-runtime
```

For the whole experience, including sandbox capabilities:

```bash
pip install agentscope-runtime
```

### (Optional) Install from Source

If you want to use the latest development version or contribute to the project, you can install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agentscope-ai/agentscope-runtime.git

cd agentscope-runtime

pip install .
```

For development, you may want to install with development dependencies:

```bash
pip install ".[dev]"
```

## Check Your Installation

To verify your installation and check the current version, run the following in Python:

```{code-cell}
import agentscope_runtime

print(f"AgentScope Runtime {agentscope_runtime.__version__} is ready!")
```

You should see the version number printed out. The expected output should look like: `AgentScope Runtime 0.1.0 is ready!`

### Check AgentScope Agent

```{code-cell}
try:
    from agentscope_runtime.engine.agents.agentscope_agent import AgentScopeAgent
    print(f"✅ {AgentScopeAgent.__name__} - Successfully imported")
except ImportError as e:
    print(f"❌ AgentScopeAgent - Import failed: {e}")
    print('💡 Try installing via: pip install "agentscope-runtime[agentscope]"')
```


## Installation Options Explained

The core runtime (`agentscope-runtime`) includes AgentScope Framework and Sandbox dependencies. See details about all installation options at [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/agentscope-runtime/blob/main/pyproject.toml).
